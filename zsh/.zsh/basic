# Required for Mac OS + iTerm2 - Ctrl+J - erase everything from the current cursor position to the beginning of the line
# Commannd+Enter is used to erase the whole line, Ctrl+U does the same, If Ctrl+U is overridden to erase from the current cursor to the beginning, it breaks Command+Enter for erasing the whole line
# Ctrk+K erases everything from the current cursor position to the end of the line; it works fine w/o binding
bindkey \^J backward-kill-line

# Ctl+D to Delete a word after cursor. Similar to Ctl+W to delete a word before cursor; Fn+Option+Backspace does the same
# Option+Shift+Backspace (in config it is `bindkey "^?" kill-word`) doesn't work as it breaks Backspace to erase a single char
bindkey "^d" kill-word
bindkey "^[[3;3~" kill-word # Fn+Option+Backspace for Ghostty, trick w/ `cat` and press Fn+Option+Backspace to reveal char sequence works in Ghostty
